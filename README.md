This is my Boilerplate with TypeScript, ReactJS, NextJS and Styled Components with Jest, husky and storybook.

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn create next-app -e https://github.com/rafaeldellaquila/next-boilerplate
```

Now just create your components
```bash
yarn generate Component
```
